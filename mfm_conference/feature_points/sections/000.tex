\section{Notation and basic definitions}

3D model consists of vertices which have definite positions.
Vertices are characterised not only by their positions,
so we will use them as indices for their properties.
The set of vertices will be noted $V$.
Certain vertices will be $v$, $u$ and $w$~---~in this document
it's assumed that these letters in formulas
mean any element from the set $V$ unless otherwise specified.

We need three sets of indices for space axes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $I = \left\{ x, y, z \right\}$ for ordinary 3D space;
  \item $I^h = \left\{ 0, x, y, z \right\}$ for homogeneous coordinates;
  \item $I^p = \left\{ x, y \right\}$ for plane.
\end{itemize}
