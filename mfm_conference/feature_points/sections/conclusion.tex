\section{Conclusions and further work}

Linear model vertices, which satisfy presented equations,
will allow to find affine transformation and shape parameters
of model on an input image.
Proposed method is helpful not only for face parameters
and not only for flat image,
but for any linear PCA model and any number of feature points' dimensions.

This work contains only constraints,
but not a feasible method to satisfy them.
Inaccuracy of feature points position estimate
was not taken into account.
Invisibility of some feature points under different transformations
was not considered here.
Distinctness of landmarks was not investigated in this paper,
but should be in future:
if chosen vertices' projections will be so close
that their position on descrete image will appear the same,
reconstruction result may be affected.
