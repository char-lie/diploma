Linear generative models,
particularly face models
\cite{BFM:1999,FaceWarehouse:2016,LSFM:2017},
are popular tools for inverse rendering problem
\cite{BFM:2002,BFM:2003,BFM:2009}.
Feature points are used in order to avoid local minima
during reconstruction
\cite{Face2Face:2016,PhotorealisticDNN:2016,RealTimeAnimation:2013}.
Choice of landmarks was not justified yet.

The aim of this paper is to present a generic approach
which allows to find feature points for PCA linear generative models.
